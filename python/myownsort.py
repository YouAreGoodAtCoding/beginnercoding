# time complexity is O(n^2)
# For n people, numbers of times the outer for loop executes is n.
# For each time outer for loop runs, inner for loop runs n times as well. so total number of steps is n^2
# This means as the number of people grows, the number of greetings (and number of steps the code takes) grows much faster
# â€” it's quadratic, not linear.

# time complexity is O(n)

# This means as the number of people grows, the number of steps the code takes grows linearly at the same pace.
# this is algorithm that just loops through and prints the name of each person.
